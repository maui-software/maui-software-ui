##  Overview

**Maui Software UI** is a graphical application for **ecoacoustic data analysis and visualization**.  
It provides a user-friendly interface built on top of the `maui-software` library, enabling researchers and practitioners to:  

- Load and organize acoustic datasets.  
- Compute a wide range of ecoacoustic indices.  
- Perform segmentation of audio files.  
- Explore the acoustic environment through rich visualizations.  

With support for both **standard spectrograms** and **false-color spectrograms**, Maui Software UI facilitates deeper insights into large ecoacoustic datasets, assisting in biodiversity monitoring and ecological research.

##  Features

- **Intuitive data loading** for ecoacoustic analysis.  
- **Built-in computation of multiple acoustic indices**, essential for ecological studies.  
- **Audio file segmentation** (automatic and manual) for detailed inspection.  
- **Interactive visualizations** including:  
  - Traditional spectrograms  
  - False-color spectrograms for enhanced interpretation  
- **Graphical user interface** developed with Dash for seamless data exploration.
